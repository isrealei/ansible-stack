## Complete Provisioning with Ansible

This project builds on a previous setup where a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) was configured using Ansible. The focus here is on deploying the **Barion** Java web application stack onto that VPC. The goal is to automate the provisioning of EC2 instances and set up all required services—such as MySQL, Memcached, RabbitMQ, Tomcat, and others—using Ansible.

## Project Overview

Managing infrastructure manually can be complex, error-prone, and time-consuming—especially when dealing with environments that need frequent provisioning or changes, such as staging or pre-production setups. Each environment involves coordinating multiple services, ensuring network security, and maintaining high availability.

To streamline this process, I automated the infrastructure provisioning using Ansible. This approach minimizes human error, accelerates deployment, and ensures that infrastructure configurations are consistent and version-controlled.

## Project Goals

The main objective was to fully automate the setup of the **Barion** application stack, including:

* Launching EC2 instances within a preconfigured VPC
* Installing and configuring services such as MySQL, Memcached, RabbitMQ, Tomcat, and any additional dependencies
* Enabling repeatable, consistent deployments through infrastructure-as-code practices

By leveraging Ansible, I ensured that all configuration and provisioning steps could be executed automatically and reliably.

## Project Tasks

* Configure and launch EC2 instances within an existing VPC
* Provision the **Barion** stack services (MySQL, Memcached, RabbitMQ, Tomcat, etc.)
* Automate the full infrastructure configuration workflow with Ansible
* Implement infrastructure-as-code principles for repeatable, scalable deployments

---

## Conclusion

Automating infrastructure provisioning is essential for building fast, reliable, and maintainable environments. This project used Ansible to deploy the **Barion** Java application stack on AWS, covering everything from compute provisioning to service configuration. The result is a fully automated and consistent deployment process that supports future scaling, version control, and rapid iteration.
